# Temperature-and-Pressure-Monitoring-for-Substation
This project aims to implement an  real-time monitoring system to track temperature and pressure parameters in substations, enhancing operational safety, predictive maintenance, and system reliability.This project focuses on developing a basic monitoring system to measure the temperature and pressure levels in a substation. Substations contain important equipment like transformers and switchgear, which can be damaged if the temperature or pressure exceeds safe limits.

By using temperature and pressure sensors, the system can continuously check these values and display them on a screen or send alerts if abnormal conditions are detected. This helps in preventing equipment damage, avoiding failures, and ensuring the safe operation of the substation.

Key Components:
Temperature Sensors: Measure the heat in transformers and surrounding areas.

Pressure Sensors: Monitor gas pressure in equipment like SF6 gas-insulated switchgear.

Microcontroller: Like Arduino or Raspberry Pi to read sensor data.

Display or Alarm: Shows current readings and alerts when values cross set limits.
